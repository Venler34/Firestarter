The forces  involved  in dissipation  are complex,  but linear  drag  model  
gives  quite  accurate  description .

(This is not ODE course, so I apologize for any shortcuts, but to find general solution 
a good strategy is to find specific solutions 𝑓(𝑡) and superimpose them)
A good guess for specific solution 𝑓𝑡=exp(−𝕚𝜔𝑡)
THE EQUATION  OF MOTION  FOR A DAMPED  HARMONIC  
OSCILLATOR
The solution we got has both imaginary and real part, 𝜔=𝜔𝑅+𝕚𝜔𝐼
We can write 
𝑓𝑡=exp −𝕚𝜔𝑡 =exp(𝜔𝐼𝑡)exp(−𝕚𝜔𝑅𝑡)
LIGHT DAMPING
Qualitatively  – in the presence  of a damping  
force  one expects  the oscillation  to continue  
while  the amplitude  decreases  exponentially,

HEAVY DAMPING
Heavy  damping  occurs  when  the degree  of damping  is large  enough  to have  system  
sluggishly  return  to equilibrium  position  (“dead  beat”) .
