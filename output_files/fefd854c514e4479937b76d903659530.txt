This is a closed -book exam worth a total of 60 points.  Please answer all questions.  
 
ONLY THE FOLLOWING ITEMS ARE ALLOWED ON YOUR DESK DURING THE EXAM:  
 
1. THIS EXAM BOOK – It contains this cover page, three  question pages and a formula sheet 
(which may be torn off). Make sure you start by putting your NAME , ID NUMBER, and 
TUTORIAL GROUP  on the front (cover) page of the exam.  
The entire exam book (minus the formula sheet)  will be handed in  at the end of the exam and 
marked.  
a. FORMULA SHEET , annotated on the printed page. The formula sheet has to be printed 
from the file provided on Quercus . 
2. A CALCULATOR , which can be anything that does NOT connect to wifi  and does NOT 
communicate with other devices. ACCEPTABLE calculators include  programmable and 
graphing calculators, scientific calculators, etc. UNACCEPTABLE calculators include: cell 
phones, tablets, laptops, etc.  
3. A PEN OR PENCIL.  
4. YOUR STUDENT ID CARD , used to check your identity . 
 
If you are missing anything from the above items, raise your hand and ask an exam supervisor to supply 
what is missing. If you are missing an item that should have been brought by you (e.g., calculator, 
pen/pencil) there is a li mited supply of extras and are on a first come, first served basis.  
 
The last page of the midterm (page #6 ) is empty and can be used for scrap notes, but only pages 2 , 3, 
& 4 will be scanne d for marking.  
 
COMPLETE SOLUTION INCLUDES:  
a) A sketch with a coordinate system , where appropriate . Where a diagram is provided, additional 
markings can be added to it.  
b) Clear and logical workings, including quoting the equations that were used, proper substitutions 
of numbers  (when necessary)  with all steps clearly indicated.  
c) The f inal answer with units and three  significant figures.

 Question I  
1. A simple pendulum consists of a 
string of length 𝐿 and a point -like 
mass 𝑚=0.055  kg attached to it. The

the pendulum, 𝜃(𝑡)=𝜃𝐴cos(𝜔𝑡+𝜃𝑖), 
as a function of time.  
a. What is the natural frequency of 
the pendulum? [2 points]  
 
 
b. What is the initial phase constant of the pendulum? [6 points]  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c. What is the total energy of this system? Indicate any assumptions/approximations you used in 
your calculations. [ 6 points]  
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. A disturbance on a string is described with an equation 𝑦(𝑥,𝑡)=𝑌𝑜sin(𝑘𝑥)cos(𝜔𝑡+𝜙𝑖). 
Determine whether this disturbance is a wave. [ 6 points]

 Question I I 
Consider a setup shown in the picture below : two identical masses  𝑚, 𝑚𝐵 on the left and 𝑚𝐴 on the 
right, connected to each other with a spring 𝑘. The mass on the right (𝑚𝐴) is connected  to a rigid support  
with a spring 4𝑘. 
 
a. Assuming both masses are displaced from equilibrium of your choice by distances 𝑥𝐴 and 𝑥𝐵, 
draw (in the picture)  and clearly label the  forces exerted on the masses by the spring. You can 
assume there is no dampening in the system and that the gravitational force on each mass is 
balanced by the normal force.  [3 points]  
 
b. Write the equation of motion of each mass.  [4 points]  
 
 
 
c. Determine the coefficient matrix for this  system  and the normal frequencies of the oscillation. [10 
points]  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d. A driver applying force 𝐹(𝑡)=𝐹0cos(𝜔𝑡) is attached to the left side of the set up.  What are the 
amplitudes  of the normal modes if the driving frequency is equal to the larger of the normal 
frequencies? [3 points]

 Question III  
Signal 𝑉1(𝑡)=𝑉𝐴(𝑡)cos(𝜔𝑡−3
4𝜋) is observed across a resistor  𝑅=50.0 Ω in RLC circ uit that also 
includes capacitor 𝐶=2.0 μF and inductor 𝐿=0.20 H. At time 𝑡=0 𝑉1(0)=2.0 V.  
a. What is the natural frequency of this circuit? [1 point]  
 
 
b. What is the damping factor 𝛾? [1 point]  
 
 
 
c. What type of behaviour would this system exibit ? Briefly j ustify your answer . [2 points]  
 
 
 
d. Determine the expressions for current in the circuit  and potential differenc e across the inductor . 
You do not have to  substitute all values, but you need to be very clear with the symbols you are 
using. [8 points]  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
e. When the signal measured across the resistor is added a the second, unknown signal  
 𝑉2(𝑡)=𝑉𝐵(𝑡)cos(𝜔𝑡+𝜙𝐵) a sinusoidal wave 𝑉(𝑡)=3.0 Vexp (−𝛾
2𝑡)sin(𝜔𝑡) is recorded.
